SSM first repository in GitHub , a warm welcoming. 

2017 - 07 - 10
Since I entered GitHub last year,2016, I havent created a single one files. Nowdays I'm going to my mentor's cooperative enterprise to work as a Front-End Intern. I think it's time to walk into the GitHub completely. I create this repository as a guide as well as a declaration.

I sincerely hope that I will become a qualified junior FE within the one month. Of course I will try my best.
